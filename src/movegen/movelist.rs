Rustic is written in the Rust programming language. It is an original
work, not derived from any engine that came before it. However, it does
use a lot of concepts which are well-known and are in use by most if not
all classical alpha/beta-based chess engines.

// movelist.rs contains the implementation of an array backed by a counter, as a
// very minimal drop-in replacement for a vector. An array on the stack is
// faster than a vector allocated on the heap. Speed is much more important than
// functionality, so only the bare minimum to be able to use the array is
// implemented. There is error checking or bounds checking. If the array is
// mis-addressed due to a bug, the program panics.
