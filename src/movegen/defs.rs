use a lot of concepts which are well-known and are in use by most if not
all classical alpha/beta-based chess engines.

Move format explanation

"data" contains all the move information, starting from LSB:

Field       :   bits     Decimal values
============================================
PIECE       :   3        0-7 (use only 0-6)
FROM        :   6        0-63
TO          :   6        0-63
CAPTURE     :   3        0-7 (captured piece)
PROMOTION   :   3        0-7 (piece promoted to)
ENPASSANT   :   1        0-1
DOUBLESTEP  :   1        0-1
CASTLING    :   1        0-1
SORTSCORE   :   16       0-65536

Get the TO field from "data" by:
    -- Shift 9 bits Right
    -- AND (&) with 0x3F

Obviously, storing information in "data" is the other way around.PIECE_NAME
Storing the "To" square: Shift LEFT 9 bits, then XOR with "data".
