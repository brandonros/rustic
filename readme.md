# Rustic Chess Engine

Rustic is a chess engine written from scratch in the Rust programming
language. It is not derived from any other engine, but it uses many
concepts that have been well-known in chess programming for many decades;
therefore, the engine still stands on the shoulders of the giants of the
past.

# User interface

The engine does not provide its own user interface. It uses the UCI and
XBoard protocols to communicate with graphical user interfaces. (XBoard is
not yet completely implemented at the time of writing. For now, use the
engine in UCI mode, which is also the default.) It is recommended that you
use a GUI to play games against the engine. Rustic is tested with these
user interfaces:

- [Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.de/)
- [XBoard/Winboard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/FAQ.html)
- [CuteChess](https://cutechess.com/)
- [Tarrasch](https://www.triplehappy.com/)
- [The Shredder GUI](https://www.shredderchess.com/)
- [Fritz / Chessbase series](https://en.chessbase.com/)
- [Scid vs PC (database)](http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/)
- [Banksia GUI](https://banksiagui.com/)

There are many other user interfaces that will probably work just fine, but its
obviously impossible to test all of them. If you have problems with a user
interface, open an issue so I can see if it can be fixed. (Assuming the
user interface is either free or open source, as I can't go and buy GUI's
just for testing purposes.)

# Features

The current feature-set for Rustic Alpha 3.0.0 is:

- Engine:
  - Bitboard board representation
  - Fancy Magic bitboard move generator
  - Transposition Table
  - UCI-protocol
- Search
  - Alpha/Beta search
  - Quiescence search
  - Check extension
  - PVS
- Move ordering
  - TT Move priority
  - MVV-LVA
  - Killer moves
- Evaluation
  - Material counting
  - Piece-Square Tables

(See changelog.md for more information.)

# Included binaries, supported platforms

Each release contains several binaries; these are compiled for different
types of CPU's. You can use the binary which runs fastest on your
particular system for maximum playing strength. Start a terminal, and run
each Rustic version in a terminal:

```
$ ./<executable_name> -p7 -h512
```

This will run perft 7 from the starting position, using a 512 MB
transposition table. Pick the version that runs perft 7 the fastest.

If you wish to run Rustic on a system for which no binary is supplied, you
can try to compile the engine yourself using the compilation tips below.
Make sure to install at least Rust version 1.46.

# Quick compiling tips

The engine includes a Makefile since Rustic Alpha 3.0.0, which makes
building the engine easier. If you wish to build the engine yourself, you
can find some quick tips below. These are meant for people who have some
experience with setting up build environments, or have them installed
already. If more information is required, see the file "build.md", or
Rustic's documentation.

## Build environment

- [Install Rust for your platform](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Windows: [Install MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
  - Make sure you install the following parts:
    - CoreUtils
    - BinUtils
    - GCC
    - Make
- MacOS:
  - [Install HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Install GNU Make
  - The command is "gmake" instead of "make", as MacOS includes its own
    (very old) version of "make".
- Make sure you install the correct Rust target for your platform, using
  Rustup:
  - Linux:
    - __stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu__
  - Windows:
    - __stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu__ (This toolchain creates compiles that
      are compatible with the GNU GDB-debugger.)
    - __stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc__ (This toolchain creates compiles that
      are compatible with Windows/Visual Studio's debugger. This will
      require the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools, because it uses the
      Microsoft Linker.)
- Install Git for your platform.

## Building Rustic

  - Start the terminal for your platform: MSYS2 (MinGW64 or MinGW32
    version) for Windows, Terminal on Mac, and for Linux, your favorite
    terminal emulator.
  - Clone Rustic: "git clone https://github.com/mvanthoor/rustic.git"
  - Switch to the "rustic" folder.
  - Run "make" (Windows, Linux) or "gmake" (MacOS).
  - A ./bin folder should be created. The Makefile will build all versions
    of Rustic for the operating system and CPU you're running on.

# Extra module

There is a module called "Extra", which copmiles some extra capabilities
into the Rustic executable.

- Command-line option -e: Rustic can run a perft suite containing 172
  tests, to see if its move generator, make, and unmake are working as
  intended. This is mainly useful for developers.
- Command-line option -w: Using this option, Rustic can perform Wizardry:
  it runs a function that generates magic numbers for use in a magic
  bitboard engine which has square A1 = 0, or LSB, and square H8 = 63. This
  is mainly useful if one wants to write their own chess engine, bus has no
  interest in writing a function to compute the magic numbers. (Though,
  doing so, will make understanding of magic bitboards much more complete.)

This module can be included by using the --features option of cargo:

```
cargo build --release --features "extra"
```

# All command-line options

```
USAGE:
    rustic.exe [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --help        Prints help information
    -k, --kiwipete    Set up KiwiPete position (ignore --fen)
    -q, --quiet       No intermediate search stats updates
    -V, --version     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --comm <comm>          Select communication protocol to use [default: uci]  [possible values: uci, xboard]
    -f, --fen <fen>            Set up the given position [default: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -
                               0 1]
    -h, --hash <hash>          Transposition Table size in MB [default: 32]
    -p, --perft <perft>        Run perft to the given depth [default: 0]
    -t, --threads <threads>    Number of CPU-threads to use [default: 1]
```

Please note that the -e (--epdtest) and -w (--wizardry) options are only
available if the "extra" module is compiled into the engine.
